## Technical Domains

I build scalable systems by applying broad technical experience and a deep grasp of the ML lifecycle, from ingestion to deployment.

<br>

### **Areas of Focus**

- **Backend development & automation**  
  - FastAPI service development and API integration  
  - Task queuing and background jobs with Celery and Redis  
  - Service orchestration and messaging between microservices  


- **Authentication systems**  
  - OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)  
  - MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library for Azure AD / Entra ID)  
  - SAML 2.0 (enterprise SSO and identity federation)  
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with custom claims  
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) for MFA  
  - Secure session management (cookie- and token-based)  
  - Token lifecycle handling (refresh, expiration, revocation)  
  - RBAC / ABAC (role- and attribute-based access control)  
  - User and machine-to-machine authentication  


- **Data Engineering**  
  - Orchestrated ETL from authenticated APIs, login-based frontends, and web-scraped data  
  - Intermediate processing with Pandas for join logic, cleanup, and schema enforcement

## Current Project Ambitions

My current work is focused on building systems that are not just automated, but unified and predictive, with centralized
data models, consistent pipelines, and actionable insights.

<br>

**Key design themes include**

- **Client-aware** â€“ surfacing contextual data across endpoints, alerts, tickets, usage, time, and human responses
- **Self-auditing** â€“ producing consistent, exportable records of service coverage and gaps
- **Proactive** â€“ identifying patterns and triggers before reactive support is needed
- **Unified** â€“ drawing from a single dataset to enable operational clarity across teams
- **Compliant by design** â€“ using internally developed automation for lifecycle events like deprovisioning, offboarding,
  and reporting

<br>

**This vision informs how I build**

- Observability pipelines that collect, transform, and interpret data from diverse sources
- ETL and orchestration systems with feedback loops and failure awareness
- Feature engineering techniques that unify and enhance fragmented data sets
- ML workflows that train models to make proactive, scalable predictions
- Reproducible ML pipelines designed for deployment and long-term support

<br>

**My personal and professional roadmap:**

- Leverage systems and monitoring expertise to deliver **resilient, production-grade ML platforms**
- Transition from scheduled automation to **real-time inference and event-driven architectures**
- Advance into **edge AI and robotics**, applying local inference and threshold-based logic for **autonomous, scalable
  decision-making**
