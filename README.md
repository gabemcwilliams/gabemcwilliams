## Current Project Ambitions

My current work is focused on building systems that are not just automated, but unified and predictive, with centralized
data models, consistent pipelines, and actionable insights.

<br>

**Key design themes include**

- **Client-aware** â€“ surfacing contextual data across endpoints, alerts, tickets, usage, time, and human responses
- **Self-auditing** â€“ producing consistent, exportable records of service coverage and gaps
- **Proactive** â€“ identifying patterns and triggers before reactive support is needed
- **Unified** â€“ drawing from a single dataset to enable operational clarity across teams
- **Compliant by design** â€“ using internally developed automation for lifecycle events like deprovisioning, offboarding,
  and reporting

<br>

**This vision informs how I build**

- Observability pipelines that collect, transform, and interpret data from diverse sources
- ETL and orchestration systems with feedback loops and failure awareness
- Feature engineering techniques that unify and enhance fragmented data sets
- ML workflows that train models to make proactive, scalable predictions
- Reproducible ML pipelines designed for deployment and long-term support

<br>

**My personal and professional roadmap includes**

- Applying systems and monitoring experience to build **resilient, production-ready ML platforms**
- Evolving from batch jobs and scheduled automation into **real-time inference and event-driven action**
- Expanding into **edge AI and robotics**, using learned thresholds and local inference for **autonomous decision-making
  at scale**
