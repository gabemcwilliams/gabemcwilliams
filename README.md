# ðŸ‘‹ About Me â€” Gabe McWilliams

Developer and architect with 20+ years in IT and a focus on data-driven automation and platform design.<br>
Currently transitioning into ML and edge inference after years of building policy, systems, and decision logic into
infrastructure and analytics tools.

## Supporting Domain Knowledge

My domain experience spans both deep technical focus and broad cross-functional exposure.

**Core focus interests:**

- Backend development & automation (FastAPI, authentication, API integration)
- Authentication systems (JWT, sessions, OAuth, TOTP)
- Data engineering (ETL, API ingestion, feature engineering, Postgres-based marts and pipelines)
- MLOps
- Business Ops
- Platform engineering (Kubernetes, MLflow, Vault, Prefect, NGINX, MinIO)

**Additional domain knowledge:**

- Frontend development (React, D3.js, dashboard tooling)
- Systems & endpoint management
- Cloud infrastructure & IaC (Terraform, AWS, Azure)
- Networking (VPN, VLAN, routing)
- Security & DevSecOps (RBAC, secrets, tenant policy)
- Backup & disaster recovery
- O365 / Exchange administration
- Observability
- Ticketing & PSA workflows

## Current Project Ambitions

My current work is focused on building systems that are not just automated, but unified and predictive, with centralized
data models, consistent pipelines, and actionable insights.

Key design themes include:

- **Client-aware** â€“ surfacing contextual data across endpoints, alerts, tickets, usage, time, and human responses
- **Self-auditing** â€“ producing consistent, exportable records of service coverage and gaps
- **Proactive** â€“ identifying patterns and triggers before reactive support is needed
- **Unified** â€“ drawing from a single dataset to enable operational clarity across teams
- **Compliant by design** â€“ using internally developed automation for lifecycle events like deprovisioning, offboarding,
  and reporting

This vision informs how I build:

- Observability pipelines that collect, transform, and interpret data from diverse sources
- ETL and orchestration systems with feedback loops and failure awareness
- Feature engineering techniques that unify and enhance fragmented data sets
- ML workflows that train models to make proactive, scalable predictions
- Reproducible ML pipelines designed for deployment and long-term support

My personal and professional roadmap includes:

- Applying systems and monitoring experience to build **resilient, production-ready ML platforms**
- Evolving from batch jobs and scheduled automation into **real-time inference and event-driven action**
- Expanding into **edge AI and robotics**, using learned thresholds and local inference for **autonomous decision-making
  at scale**
